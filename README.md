# Dr.WithYouWebServer

Dr.WithYou(Web) is an application designed for community doctors. Now in China, community doctors and their regular follow-ups are predominant phenomenon. For patients with chronic diseases, what they need is long-term monitering rather than irrgular visits to doctors.

We hope to design such an application helped to master the whole process effectively. Doctors can assign daily checklists to their patients, which should be submitted on time according to prescriptions. Also doctors can see the uploaded checklist data and monitor patients conditions, making sure if a visit is needed or not.
